# Frogger-like Arcade Game

## How to open the application
* From the "frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game" folder, open the "index.html" file.

## How to play the game
* The player starts on the grassy area of the screen.
* Move the player using the keyboard's cursor keys.
* When a player gets to the water at the top of the screen, the player is awarded 100 points. The score will be displayed at the bottom of the grassy area.
* If the player collides with one of the enemy bugs an explosion will occur. This can happen 3 times, but on the fourth collision the game will end and the final score will be displayed. The game will automatically reset.
